Allison was on it. The burning fuel pushed the behemoth of steel into the sky as a cloud of black and white smoke ballooned around it. Allison and her team were headed to a space station in the far reaches of the Earthling territory. It had been several decades since they had left Earth for good, but they were still Earthlings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was called the Apollo Station. Allison vaguely remembered a story about a different Apollo mission, but she couldn&rsquo;t gather any specific details. As they left the atmosphere of their planet behind, the mission commander&mdash; Gerald Lylan&mdash; spoke over the roar of the engines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have left the planet behind. We are not coming back for a long time. I hope you said your good-byes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison had. She had bid farewell to her family and friends the night before. Now she dearly missed them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Lylan continued. &ldquo;When we get to Apollo, the existing team will show us around. We have already been assigned positions, so the integration should be smooth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a signal from the pilot, Lylan sat back down. It must be time for the cambyon jump, Allison reckoned. Soon before the egress from Earth, a physicist had discovered a type of phase-changing particle, capable of switching between bradyon and tachyon form. It was really ingenious, she had been told. She didn&rsquo;t entirely understand them, but no one else did either, so it was alright. She was an astrobiologist, not a rocket scientist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot pulled a lever back. For a brief moment, nothing happened. Then, the stars blinked to a different position. One star was very bright, about the size of the sun viewed from their home planet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo was orbiting it. The team could see it transiting across that star.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot radioed to the station. &ldquo;This is Echo-Sierra-Alpha-Nine-Eight. Apollo Station, do you read me? Over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is Apollo Station. We hear you. Over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Apollo Station, permission to land?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it dissolved to pilot jargon about where to land, transmissions of telemetry. Eventually, they docked and the new team&mdash; there were five of them, counting Allison and Lylan&mdash; exited the spacecraft. Behind them, the five oldest members of Apollo&rsquo;s crew got onto the ship. They would help unload some supplies, then they would leave. It worked like this every crew rotation. In six rotations, Allison would leave. It was a thirty-five person crew. The rotations came every few months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication with home was impossible in any reasonable window because of how far out they were. The radio communications would take at least a year and a half to go one way. They also couldn&rsquo;t send cambyonic signals&mdash; it was too expensive to make regular jumps. Instead, crewmembers send letters back with the leaving crewmembers. There were some letters in the cargo that was currently being unloaded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the existing crewmembers walked over to Allison. &ldquo;Dr. Katerina?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison turned to him. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and put his hand out. She shook it. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Eli Braden. I&rsquo;m the resident agent. I hear you&rsquo;re the astrobiologist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you around, then.&rdquo; Eli walked away, Allison following closely. As they left the flurry of motion around the landing craft, they came to a large window. Through it, Allison could see the star. It was green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was beautiful. Through the tinted windows, she could&rsquo;ve stared at it for hours. It was a green glass sea, light and heat swimming in a symphony of stardust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I became an astronomer,&rdquo; Eli said. &ldquo;The stars enchanted me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison nodded and looked at it a while longer. Eli continued. &ldquo;We call it the Howling Star. Or the Howler. Or whatever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone ran up to Eli. &ldquo;We found another one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli turned. &ldquo;Where is it this time, John?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The hallway connecting Cells A and B. It&rsquo;s still only on the A side.&rdquo; The Apollo station was separated into five cells, with seven staff assigned to each cell. Allison remembered reading about this design in her manuals. The cells, large building-sized facilities, were attached only superficially, with doors locked on both sides. If ever the Apollo station needed more cells, they could be easily attached. Each cell had four attaching points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli turned to Allison, &ldquo;I need to look at this before we can get to your assignment. It&rsquo;s on the way, I promise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hallway was relatively short. The doors were only about a meter and a half from the beginning of the hallway. Allison realized what John had been talking about. Long, deep marks were gouged into the shiny metal. Eli knelt down and brushed them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is not the first time this has happened.&rdquo; Eli shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alway in Cell A. We have no idea what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; Eli slumped down and leaned against the scratches. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the manager on this station. I&rsquo;m supposed to know how to fix this. I just can&rsquo;t figure it out. Everyone has a solid alibi. Far as I can tell, </span><span class="c2 c7">no one</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is doing this to the station.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison frowned. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m just an astrobiologist, not a detective, but I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out.&rdquo; Allison&rsquo;s parents, though, had been detectives. She had worked at their agency for a few years, before she pursued her graduate degree, so she knew a lot of things about detectivery. Enough to know that wasn&rsquo;t a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify the suspects. Analyze data. Form storylines. Fact check. Repeat. Those were the steps she followed. She didn&rsquo;t know about others, but it had always worked for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison helped Eli up. &ldquo;Will you take me to my assignment now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli nodded and started walking. She caught up. &ldquo;What exactly is your job? You said you were an agent, but what does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli nodded again. &ldquo;I work for the government.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Well, we all do, but I don&rsquo;t for the space agency. I&rsquo;m kinda the manager of the station and, more specifically, for this cell. I stay on longer than anyone else, just to provide a kind of stability. You could say I&rsquo;m in charge, but I don&rsquo;t really tell anyone what to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli stopped beside a door. He rapped his knuckles on it, then scanned his ID card. The doors swung open. Inside, strands of plants hung from the ceiling up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Be aware, this room does not have the magnetic gravity.&rdquo; In the rest of the station, a slight electromagnetic field was being produced, simulating the normal gravity of their new home. Metal strips in the spacefarers&rsquo; shoes and on their epaulets kept them tethered down. In this plant room, the field was turned off, allowing for the normal microgravity of orbit to take effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison stepped into the room. She felt the magnetic gravity disappear behind her. The force of her step propelled her up, into the plants. All around her, the dark vivacious green enchanted her, reminding her of simpler days, years ago, running through the woods with her best friends&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She floated through the forest, just remembering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison collided with someone else. They grunted in surprise. They turned. The person was a slender woman wearing glasses. Her hair floated freely behind her. If Allison&rsquo;s hadn&rsquo;t been done up in a bun, she assumed that hers would be the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; the woman said cheerfully. &ldquo;You must be Allison!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am, yes. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman smiled. &ldquo;Lexy. Alexandra Sheila Donovan, if we&rsquo;re being fancy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you a biologist?&rdquo; Allison asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Lexy smiled and spun around. &ldquo;Yes. I just love plants!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can tell.&rdquo; Allison was honestly impressed at Lexy&rsquo;s demeanor. She was very cheerful and carefree. Allison had never been able to maintain that. Something was always going wrong, it seemed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Lexy&rsquo;s smile grew larger, somehow. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;An astrobiologist?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Allison nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. Why did you think I was in here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought you might just be visiting the plants. I would.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Allison smiled, trying to reflect the energy that Lexy was showing to her. Allison&rsquo;s mind was somewhere else. It was on the vandalism. Allison really wanted to investigate. But one of her skills, useful as a graduate student and now as a practicing astrobiologist, was focus. Indomitable will and focus. She cleared her mind of the vandalism and focused on the plants.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lexy, will you show me around? I want to start working soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Lexy beamed. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli Braden looked at the scratches. After dropping Dr. Katerina off, he had returned to the scene of the crime. It really wasn&rsquo;t any of the crew. They all had solid alibis. Security recordings proved that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison Katerina. The name had been nagging at him since he heard it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slapped his forehead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison &lsquo;Eyes&rsquo; Katerina. Her parents&rsquo; star detective. The one that solved his brother&rsquo;s murder. His brother was in jail now, where he belonged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John, the one that had informed him of the newest vandalism&mdash; he was a mathematician, calculating orbital injections and the like, turned the corner and walked toward Eli. &ldquo;Hey, chief. You&rsquo;ve got a letter here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks, bud.&rdquo; Eli took the letter. He opened it and began to read.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Elias,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I figure I should be the one to tell you. Marie died yesterday. It was my fault, really. I was the one that stabbed her, all those years ago. My job is finally done. Her brothers died then; I&rsquo;ve been waiting to complete the set. I know you loved her and I know how much this hurts you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebenezer</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli leaned against the wall. He slid down and hung his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It finally happened,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She finally died. Ben got her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebenezer was his murderer brother. He had attempted to kill Eli&rsquo;s fiancee and family. He had killed her four brothers, but had only fatally wounded Marie. Her sister hadn&rsquo;t been there. Marie had been in a coma for several years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now she was gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did anything matter. Anymore.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison floated toward the exit. As she stepped through the gateway, the magnetic field pulled her down to the floor. Lexy followed behind her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexy led them to the mess hall, where they enjoyed&mdash; enjoyed would be a strong term; space food is rather bland&mdash; a filling meal. After that, they headed to bed. Lexy showed Allison to hers, then left to get to her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison woke in the middle of the night. Something deep inside her was shaking. Some violent memory of a day long ago, something from her days at the agency. The memories of stalking some criminal or another catching up to her. She sat on the side of her bed. Images of angry men and women rolled through her mind. Allison stood up and shook her head, trying to clear it. She pushed open her door and walked briskly through the hallway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked to the main atrium&mdash; where the window showed the Howling Star in the distance. Allison looked out at the star again. Despite its name, it had a calming effect on the former detective. The bright burning reminded her of the forest. The green light was enchanting. Intellectually, Allison knew that the star wasn&rsquo;t really green. There was a coating on the window blocking higher frequencies of the light. That was also why she could look directly at it. It didn&rsquo;t really matter to her, though. The light was hers to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes of gazing quietly at the Howler, Allison continued to walk around the cell. This cell was the newest one. It had the ship docking area, as well as the plant room. It had a few sleeping quarters, but nothing else. The mess hall where she and Lexy had had dinner the night before was in a different cell. Allison wasn&rsquo;t sure of the layout of the entire station yet. Deep in thought, Allison accidentally ran into someone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Allison said. She looked at the person. It was Eli. &ldquo;Hey, Eli. Why are you up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli looked around. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. You?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded. &ldquo;Same.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli took a deep breath. &ldquo;I found some more vandalism. I was hoping I could use some of that Eyes Katerina skill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison took a step back. &ldquo;H-how? How do you know who I was?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You caught a murderer. I knew hi&mdash; his victims.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded. &ldquo;Okay. Take me to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli pushed open a door. It opened into a closet. Before he opened it all the way, he paused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This closet is used for storing some chemicals Alexandra is using on the plants. It&rsquo;s a whole thing. She&rsquo;ll explain it, probably.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened it fully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five deep gashes reached around all the walls. Shattered bottles lay on the floor, their non-magnetic contents floating through the air. The brightly colored liquids danced like the flows in the Howling Star.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison looked at Eli.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When did this happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Recently. Alexandra popped in here right before I sealed the cells; she would&rsquo;ve mentioned something. It had to have been tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison looked at Eli. &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;seal the cells&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli looked at the station&rsquo;s scars. &ldquo;I lock the doors between the cells. Each one is fully independent at night. In case something goes wrong in one cell, it won&rsquo;t transfer around. Kinda silly, if you aske me, but protocol is protocol.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison nodded. If the cells were separated, then the vandal had to be someone that slept in this cell. That limited the amount of suspects significantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who all is quartered in this cell?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli counted on his fingers. &ldquo;You and I, Alexandra Donovan, Gerald Lylan, Qi Asimov, and Christian Holt. You and Lylan just arrived.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;You know that. It can&rsquo;t be either of you; this has been going on too long for that. That leaves Asimov, Alexandra, or Christian.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met Asimov or Holt yet. Where do they work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Holt&rsquo;s a physicist. His grandpa discovered cambyons, actually. Anyway, he&rsquo;s a physicist. He works with John and I, over in Cell C. I&rsquo;ve talked to him about this before. He&rsquo;s had a solid alibi, far as I could tell. You could try talking to him again, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What about Asimov?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a science fiction author.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison looked shocked. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli laughed. &ldquo;No. Isaac Asimov was an author, back in the twentieth century. It was a joke. Asimov is a geologist. He works on our terraforming project. He&rsquo;s in Cell D.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to them tomorrow, if I can get Lexy to give me time off. Why do you call her Alexandra, by the way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli looked around, uncomfortably. &ldquo;We used to be friends, but I made some mistakes.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t talk to me anymore. I stopped calling her Lexy. It just felt wrong. Don&rsquo;t ask her about it, please. It would only make her sad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison floated next to Lexy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, how&rsquo;d you sleep last night?&rdquo; Allison asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like an insomniac that takes sleeping pills,&rdquo; Lexy flashed a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Allison asked. &ldquo;Take sleeping pills, I mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. I just meant I slept really well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Allison said.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Lexy started filling a spray bottle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Allison asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fungicide. A few months ago, we had someone come up, but they hadn&rsquo;t properly quarantined and they brought up an annoying fungus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is heavily diluted. Our concentrated version is toxic to most organisms. Causes intense pain, and the like.&rdquo; Lexy handed Allison a black plastic bottle with a danger symbol on it, then flew off to apply the fungicide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison didn&rsquo;t even study plants. She had no idea what she was doing here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after that, Eli floated up beside her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Allison, can I borrow you for a minute?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison looked over and down at Lexy. She was looking intensely at her work, with a grim look on her face, distinctly unlike the Lexy Allison knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison nodded to Eli. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duo pushed off the workstation, flying through the green plants, arriving at the gateway. The magnetic gravity took hold of them and they began to walk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you need to talk about?&rdquo; Allison asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I remembered we have cameras, scattered about the station. We can check the tapes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh. Why are there cameras?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Great question. I think something about an immortal record of our science.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Allison hummed. &ldquo;Where are the tapes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have them in my office. Ah! Here we are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli pushed open the door to his office. He sat down at his desk and pulled up the files on his computer. He scrolled to the right camera and played the clip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c2">For a few minutes, the camera is still and silent on the door to the storage closet. Then, Lexy opens the door. She walks inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Eli switched to the camera inside the closet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c2">Lexy rummages around, looking for something. She pulls out a bottle, then walks out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Eli paused the video. &ldquo;I was around for this part. After she took you to your room, she found that chemical, took it to the plant lab, then she went to her room. I was locking the doors at the time. That&rsquo;s why I saw this.&rdquo; He unpaused the video. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c2">For a long moment, nothing happens. As Eli switches the playback to a higher speed, the screen ripples. Then, a dark figure rushes in and out of the closet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Eli said. He went back and played the video at normal speed. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c2">This darkened figure walks slowly into frame. Their gait is halting and unsteady. It pushes open the closet door.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Eli switched to the inside camera again.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c2">The large figure raises a hand. Giant claws extend, protruding from its fingers. It slashes across the room, shattering bottles and carving deeply into the wall. Just as it arrived, the figure walks out of the closet.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo; Allison asked. Eli put the video in reverse and followed the vandal as it moved back in time. It stalked down the hallways in reverse, eventually entering a lavatory.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sneaky devil,&rdquo; Eli whispered. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have cameras in there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s take a look around in there,&rdquo; Allison suggested.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; Eli suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a women&rsquo;s room. I&rsquo;ll stay here and look over the footage from other incidents.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Allison walked out of Eli&rsquo;s office.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli scrolled back through the timeline. All the recorded incidents were like the one in the supply closet. The attacker entered an area, then damages it. Eli started plotting the locations of the attacks on a map of the station. He couldn&rsquo;t see any pattern. That didn&rsquo;t mean there wasn&rsquo;t one; he just couldn&rsquo;t see it. This was the issue. He didn&rsquo;t have a lick of crime-solving ability. Not like Allison. She could do anything. Even his suggestion of the security cameras just came from a novel he had been reading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes Katerina had caught his brother. His brother had killed his fianc&eacute;e. His fianc&eacute;e had a sister, the only living sibling. That sibling lived on the station and was friends with Allison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was why he didn&rsquo;t call her Lexy. He&rsquo;d gotten Marie killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli screamed silently, again feeling the sharp loss of the only person he&rsquo;d cared about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He missed her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he worked. To numb his pain.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison walked back into the plant lab. She soared up to the workbench. After she had inspected the bathroom&mdash; there hadn&rsquo;t been anything there&mdash; she had reported to Eli. With no other leads, she returned to the lab. Lexy wasn&rsquo;t at the bench. She was probably out doing something with the plants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison looked about and spotted her. Allison pushed off and went down to where Lexy was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are we doing here?&rdquo; Allison smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexy looked up and smiled and began to explain.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison slept peacefully that night. But when she awoke, she was met with a storm of confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, Elias!&rdquo; someone thundered. His voice carried even through the walls, into Allison&rsquo;s room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison quickly dressed as they continued to argue. Their voices dropped lower, falling out of her ears. She rushed into the crowd. Most of the crew was there. When she saw what they were gathered around, she gasped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Gerald?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Lylan was dead. His body lay cold and dead, slashes across his chest. His torso was shredded, dried blood pooled on the floor. His death wounds were the same pattern as all the other vandalisms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c7">This just got </span><span class="c2">very</span><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Someone pushed past Allison with a sheet. They wrapped Lylan&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all can argue later. It is not right to disrespect the dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man that had yelled at Eli looked at the one that had wrapped Lylan. &ldquo;Thank you, Qi.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that was Qi Asimov. He seemed respectable.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Eli dropped to the floor, crouching.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is a tragedy, I agree. But there&rsquo;s nothing we can do. We need to continue our work. I will find the murderer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Like you found the vandal?&rdquo; the man said incredulously.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Christian!&rdquo; Eli said. &ldquo;This is going to change things. Allison there was a professional detective a few years ago. She&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Allison&rsquo;s eyes widened at the implication of that. She didn&rsquo;t know if she could do this as quickly as needed. But she would try her best.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can do it,&rdquo; Allison said. For some reason, that seemed to calm the crowd and they began to disperse.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Allison walked over to Eli, who was still crouching on the floor.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write a program to monitor the camera feeds. It will alert us both when the murderer shows up again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Allison said. Eli jumped up and ran off.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Allison stood motionless for a second, then walked over to the plant lab.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That evening, an alarm blared in Allison&rsquo;s room. For a moment, she was utterly confused, but then she remembered Eli&rsquo;s program.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That meant that the monster was back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison ran out of her room. She didn&rsquo;t know where it was. She ran around the outside of the central block of rooms. She would go to that bathroom and&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">She stopped dead in her pathway. In front of the window, there stood the beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was several feet taller than an average person. It hunched its back, to avoid hitting the ceiling. Its arms hung down, ending in giant claws. The monster turned and looked at Allison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, Ally,&rdquo; it growled. Its voice sounded like nails on a chalkboard. &ldquo;I expected you would get this far. I didn&rsquo;t think it would take this long, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ally yelled at it. &ldquo;You killed Gerald!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cocked its head. &ldquo;I suppose I did. Would you like to watch this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It raised its clenched fist. A struggling figure pushed against their captor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexy screamed for Allison to get away, but she refused. Allison rushed toward the monster and its captive astrobiologist. With a single swipe from the murderer, Allison was thrown back twenty or thirty feet, landing right next to the door to the plant lab with a sickening crunch and a wave of pain.s</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden flash of inspiration came to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood, the intense pain of a broken rib nearly pushing her down. Her brain shot her full of adrenaline and she crashed through the door. She rocketed up to the workstation and grabbed the fungicide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pushed back down to the gateway. When the magnetic gravity grabbed her, the inexpressably intense pain returned. She collapsed to the floor. The monster was drawing closer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ally, as an astrobiologist, I thought you would&rsquo;ve figured it out by now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer was only a few yards away now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How does </span><span class="c2 c7">first contact</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;feel?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison loosened the cap of the fungicide, then threw the bottle with the force and accuracy of an All-American baseball player. The non-magnetic bottle and liquid soared without descent, smacking the monster squarely in the face. The loosened cap dislodged, spraying the liquid in its face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shrieked, pulling its hands up to its head. As it did so, it dropped Lexy. She dashed over to Allison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quick thinking,&rdquo; Lexy said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster collapsed, shaking the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison groaned from the pain. She and Lexy looked over at the monster. It seized a few times, then fell still. Its dull black skin grew shiny. It dissolved, a tarrish liquid flowing across the station floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still, there was a body in the center of the liquid. The person was breathing heavily, lying facedown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexy walked up to it. She flipped it over, gasping when she saw his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli Braden was the monster.</span></p></body></html>
